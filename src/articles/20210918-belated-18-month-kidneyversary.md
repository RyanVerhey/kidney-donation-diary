Hello everyone! I'm sorry it's been so long since the last update. Since my last update in April, not a lot has happened health-wise for me. My recipient and I have hung out a few times, both virtually playing Rocket League or Animal Crossing, and in person (with my wife and her mom), but the biggest news is that my wife and I were invited to celebrate my recipient's and my 18 month kidneyversary at their house in July.

It was so much fun! Everyone was vaccinated, so we were all able to hang out maskless which was nice, and it was so much fun! We spent all day at their house, swimming in their pool and having fun. It was also nice to spend some time with her siblings, who we had only met once briefly before then. My recipient's dad grilled hot dogs and chicken for lunch, and the highlight was dessert: my recipient made a _HUGE_ cake, the first cake she had ever made! It was a pineapple cake with coconut frosting, and it was absolutely delicious! I was so impressed by her cake, it was fantastic for her first time making one!

After dessert we spent some time catching fireflies in their backyard. It was my first time doing that because we don't have fireflies where I grew up on the West Coast, and it was fun! Unfortunately we only managed to catch a couple because there weren't many out that night, but it was still a lot of fun. We all hung out for a while longer on their back porch until late into the evening.

We had so much fun, and it was really nice to spend more time with my recipient and her family. Unfortunately since then research has showed that the vaccines don’t always prevent transmission, so we’ve had to stop in person visits for the foreseeable future. Hopefully we can do something like this again in the future once everything is safer.

Sorry again for the delay in posting, just assume no news is good news! As usual, I'll post any updates here. Thanks for reading!
