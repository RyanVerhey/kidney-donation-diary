title: Surgery Date Set (Part 2)
date: 2020-01-07

Today I finally heard back from the hospital. After coordinating with the children’s hospital that will be doing the recipient’s surgery, they settled on January 15, a week from tomorrow. That’s not a lot of notice, so I started making as many plans as I could. Just like before, the children’s hospital needs to do another tissue cross-match blood test, butI still need to hear back on the date for that. I was told they like to do it the day before, so until they tell me, that’s what I’m planning on.

Thankfully, I’m feeling better. My mild cold turned into a severe sore throat and stuffy nose unfortunately, but now my throat isn’t sore anymore and my nasal congestion is almost gone. I should be all healthy by the 15th. But to make sure, I’ll just need to quarantine myself until next Wednesday! I’ll make sure to update you all again before the surgery, and as soon as I feel well enough afterwards. Wish me luck!
