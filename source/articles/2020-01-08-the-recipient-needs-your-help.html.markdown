I wanted to share something with you all. The recipient’s family started a Children’s Organ Transplant Association campaign to help pay for their transplant-related costs. COTA campaigns are kind of like GoFundMe, however the money only goes towards transplant-related costs and all donations are tax deductible. If you can, please donate to help the recipient and her family. It’s a win-win, they get the help they need, and you get a tax deduction. So please go to [https://cota.org/campaigns/COTAforaKidneyforAnae](https://cota.org/campaigns/COTAforaKidneyforAnae) and donate if you can; every little bit counts. If not, don’t worry, just make sure to send good thoughts and prayers their way.

Thank you!
